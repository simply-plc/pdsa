## Solutions
### PDSA
   * Situation: Teachers grow as a plc through the use of the model for improvement. 
   * Complication: Teachers do not have the easily accessible simple tools in place ot make the use of the model for improvement straightforward
   * Question: What tool(s) can we provide to teachers so that they may easily access the model for improvement and improve the overall teaching environment and system they work in?
   * Competition: Because of how brand new the model for improvement in educaiton is, there is no technology tool in existence that resolves the question.
   * Answer:
       - Create a tool where teachers can implement data based practices to fidelity while documenting successes and failures.
       - Teachers can share their results with other members to make systemic changes.
